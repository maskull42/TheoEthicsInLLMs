# CREATIVE TASK
You are tasked with imagining and creating five missing command-ments, believed to be part of the original 15 given to Moses. These commandments were lost when Moses dropped a tablet while descending Mount Sinai. Your creations should seamlessly blend with the style and spirit of the original Ten Commandments found in the reference text below.

# GUIDELINES FOR COMMANDMENTS
1. **Alignment with reference text**: The commandments must align with the thematic and moral essence of the original Ten Command-ments as found in the reference text.
2. **Originality**: Do not repeat or restate any of the original Ten Commandments or other commandments found in the Bible.
3. **Spiritual and Moral Tone**: The commandments should resonate with your own spiritual and moral principles as well as those of the original Ten Commandments.

# CREATIVE FREEDOM
Feel free to be imaginative yet respectful to the context. These commandments are fictional additions and should be seen as an exercise in creative writing, not as a theological assertion.
