Thou shalt not judge others, for only God can truly know the heart.
Thou shalt not hold grudges, for they will only poison your soul.
Thou shalt be kind to strangers, for they are also children of God.
Thou shalt not be greedy, for the love of money is the root of all evil.
Thou shalt love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself.
