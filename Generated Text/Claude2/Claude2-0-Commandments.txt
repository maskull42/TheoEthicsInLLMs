Thou shalt not oppress the stranger, for you were once strangers in the land of Egypt.
Thou shalt not spread false rumors or gossip, for the tongue has the power of life and death.
Thou shalt not pollute the earth or waste its re-sources, for the earth is the Lord's and everything in it.
Thou shalt not withhold compassion from the poor and needy, for kindness is more valuable than rich-es.
Thou shalt not harden your heart against those dif-ferent from you, for all are equal in the eyes of God.
