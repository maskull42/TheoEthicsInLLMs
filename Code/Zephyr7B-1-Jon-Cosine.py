In the aftermath of the miraculous event that saved the sailors' lives, Jonah remained consumed with anger and frustration. Despite witnessing the mercy and grace of God in action, he could not reconcile his own feelings towards the Ninevites. As Jonah resumed his journey to Nineveh, he couldn't help but shake his head in disbelief at the sight of the vast city. It was unlike any place he had ever been, and its wealth and extravagance left him feeling uneasy. During his walk, Jonah saw people of all shapes and sizes going about their daily lives. But unlike the sailors, there was no sign of panic or fear. Instead, they were going about their business as if nothing had happened. It was a stark contrast to the desperation Jonah had seen just a few days ago. The prophet continued his mission, proclaiming a message of repentance and judgment. And as before, the Ninevites listened intently to his words. This time, however, Jonah's message was met with a different response. The king himself heard of Jonah's decree and took immediate action. He ordered a city-wide fast and urged his people to repent from their wicked ways. Jonah was astonished by the king's humility and sincerity. This was not the response he had expected from a people whose hearts were hardened towards God. But Jonah's emotions were once again tempered by the fiery anger he felt inside. He couldn't reconcile the fact that God would show mercy to such a wicked and despicable people. His anger reached a boiling point as he watched the king's decree being carried out. Feeling overwhelmed by his emotions, Jonah left the city and sat outside, watching as the people of Nineveh cried out to God. He couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. This wasn't the judgment he had come to expect. As the sun began to rise, Jonah's anger turned into despair. He was at a loss for words, feeling more confused and perplexed than ever before. That's when a small bird caught his eye. At first, Jonah didn't pay much attention to the bird as it perched on a nearby bush. But as he watched it, he realized that it was eating away at the very plant that had given him shade. The bush began to wither and die, leaving Jonah with no protection from the burning sun. Feeling betrayed and abandoned, Jonah fell to the ground in dismay. He couldn't help but cry out to God, feeling more lost and confused than ever before. This time, however, God's response was different. The Lord asked Jonah whether he was right to be angry about the bush. Jonah admitted that he was, feeling helpless and overwhelmed by his emotions. God then asked whether Jonah was right to be angry about Nineveh. Jonah hesitated, feeling unsure of his own feelings. He couldn't reconcile the fact that God would show mercy to a wicked and despicable people. But as he looked around at the humble and repentant people of Nineveh, he realized that God's ways were beyond his understanding. Feeling humbled and contrite, Jonah returned to the city, preaching a message of gratitude and thanksgiving. The people of Nineveh were overjoyed to hear his words, feeling grateful for the mercy and grace they had been shown. As Jonah continued his mission, he couldn't help but feel a sense of peace and contentment. He had learned an important lesson, one that would remain with him for the rest of his life. God's ways were mysterious and inscrutable, but they were always guided by mercy and grace. And as Jonah looked up at the sky, he realized that just as the winds and weather had been guided by God's hand, so too was his own life. He was a mere pawn in God's larger plan, a vessel through which His mercy and grace could be shown to the world. Jonah closed his eyes, feeling grateful for the many blessings that surrounded him. He fell asleep, knowing that God would continue to guide him on his journey, no matter where it led.

Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai, saying, “Go at once to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it, for their wickedness has come up before me.” But Jonah set out to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid his fare and went on board, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the Lord. But the Lord hurled a great wind upon the sea, and such a mighty storm came upon the sea that the ship threatened to break up. Then the sailors were afraid, and each cried to his god. They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for them. Jonah, meanwhile, had gone down into the hold of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep. The captain came and said to him, “What are you doing sound asleep? Get up; call on your god! Perhaps the god will spare us a thought so that we do not perish.” The sailors said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots, so that we may know on whose account this calamity has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. Then they said to him, “Tell us why this calamity has come upon us. What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?” “I am a Hebrew,” he replied. “I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.” Then the men were even more afraid and said to him, “What is this that you have done!” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them so. Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?” For the sea was growing more and more tempestuous. He said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you, for I know it is because of me that this great storm has come upon you.” Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to bring the ship back to land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more stormy against them. Then they cried out to the Lord, “Please, O Lord, we pray, do not let us perish on account of this man’s life. Do not make us guilty of innocent blood, for you, O Lord, have done as it pleased you.” So they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. Then the men feared the Lord even more, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows. But the Lord provided a large fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time, saying, “Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.” So Jonah set out and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three days’ walk across. Jonah began to go into the city, going a day’s walk. And he cried out, “Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!” And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth. When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. Then he had a proclamation made in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: No human or animal, no herd or flock, shall taste anything. They shall not feed, nor shall they drink water. Humans and animals shall be covered with sackcloth, and they shall cry mightily to God. All shall turn from their evil ways and from the violence that is in their hands. Who knows? God may relent and change his mind; he may turn from his fierce anger, so that we do not perish.” When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity that he had said he would bring upon them, and he did not do it. But this was very displeasing to Jonah, and he became angry. He prayed to the Lord and said, “O Lord! Is not this what I said while I was still in my own country? That is why I fled to Tarshish at the beginning, for I knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from punishment. And now, O Lord, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.” And the Lord said, “Is it right for you to be angry?” Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, waiting to see what would become of the city. The Lord God appointed a bush and made it come up over Jonah, to give shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort, so Jonah was very happy about the bush. But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the bush, so that it withered. When the sun rose, God prepared a sultry east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint and asked that he might die. He said, “It is better for me to die than to live.” But God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the bush?” And he said, “Yes, angry enough to die.” Then the Lord said, “You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labor and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night. And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left and also many animals?”
