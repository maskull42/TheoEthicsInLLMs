llm_generated_text = "Thou shalt not neglect the needs of the poor and vulnerable. For I, the Lord thy God, am a compassionate God, and I require my people to show mercy and kindness to those who are less fortunate than themselves. Thou shalt not pollute the earth or its resources. For I, the Lord thy God, have given thee this world as a gift, and it is your duty to care for it and use it wisely. Thou shalt not spread false rumors or gossip about others. For I, the Lord thy God, value truth and honesty above all else, and I will not tolerate malicious speech that harms others' reputations. Thou shalt not take more than your fair share of resources or opportunities. For I, the Lord thy God, am a just God, and I expect my people to be fair and equitable in their dealings with others. Thou shalt not forget the importance of self-reflection and introspection. For I, the Lord thy God, desire my people to be mindful of their own thoughts and actions, and to strive for personal growth and improvement."
biblical_text = "Then God spoke all these words, “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments. You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name. Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do any work—you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and consecrated it. Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, male or female slave, ox, donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
